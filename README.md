# NameNormalization
Natural Language Processing tool for standardizing company names to a standard form.

# Introduction
This project aims to standardize a list of similar company names (for example: JPMC, JPMorgan, J.P.Morgan Chase) to their standard form (e.g., JPMorgan Chase & Co.). Traditional string matching approaches like Levenshtein Distance may be slow, hence NLP is utilized for efficiency.
